The HTS setup is separated into *projects*, as shown below, to keep data and configurations organized. Each project folder as three subfolders:

1. **Admin**: not used for much anymore
2. **Resources**: subfolders containing configuration text files, images, sound clips, MATLAB scripts, etc. 
3. **Subjects**: subject data folders

The location of the root Projects folder is different for the HTS and HTS Controller:

- HTS: C:\\Users\\\<user\>\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Eaton-Peabody Labs\\Hearing Test Suite\\Projects
- HTS Controller: C:\\Users\\\<user\>\\Documents\\EPL\\HTS\\Projects

It is important to keep the resources synced between the HTS Controller device and the HTS device is important. This process is a bit in flux at the moment.
