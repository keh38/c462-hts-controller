The Basic measurements is where to configure and run:

1. Audiograms
2. Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL)
3. Questionnaires

An example Audiogram configuration is shown below. On the HTS Controller, configurations can be loaded, modified, and saved. If the HTS Controller is connected to a running instance of the HTS, pressing the "Measure" button starts the measurement on the tablet. The progress is logged here and the measurement can be stopped at any time.

The same Audiogram measurement can be started directly on the Basic measurements tab of the HTS app, if the resources have been properly synced. Note there is no way to configure the measurement on the tablet.
