The HTS Controller and HTS apps can be started in any order. The HTS Controller automatically searches for a direct Ethernet connection to a running instance of the HTS app. The status bar at the bottom of the HTS Controller indicates the state of that connection.

The status bar also shows the current scene being run on the tablet side.

The HTS app itself indicates its awareness of a connection to the HTS Controller by turning green the network icon at the top of the screen.
