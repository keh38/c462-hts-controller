When testing subjects in practice, it is not convenient to run one measurement at a time as described above. Instead, it is more practical to organize a sequence of measurements into a *protocol file* and to run them automatically, one after the other.

The list of protocol files is available on the Protocols tab. Pressing "Edit" opens a text editor to modify the .xml file.

Pressing "Open" changes the Protocols tab to show the list of tests contained in the protocol file. Pressing "Start" begins the protocol and logs its progress. The protocol can be stopped at any time.

Protocol files can be selected and run directly on the tablet using the Protocols tab on the HTS app.
