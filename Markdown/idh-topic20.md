Double-clicking the HTS shortcut on the tablet desktop starts the *HTS Launcher* app, shown below. The purpose of this app is to ensure proper configuration of the hardware (especially the 8-channel sound card), something that the HTS app itself is unable to do, for various technical reasons.

The Launcher pauses for several seconds to provide an opportunity to open the configuration dialog. *Press the Enter key at any time to bypass the pause interval and start the HTS app immediately.*

### Configuration dialog

Press the "C" key to open the configuration dialog. 

The option highlighted with the red box is of particular use for getting started. On the tablet as used by the subject, the HTS app should run full screen (i.e.: not windowed). But this behavior is cumbersome when trying to run the HTS and the HTS controller on the same PC. Therefore, the HTS can be run windowed so it can share a screen with the controller. The window size is arbitrary, but an aspect ratio of 3:2 is the best representation of how things will appear to the subject.

Note this operation only needs to be done one time: the setting is remembered and applied to future sessions.
